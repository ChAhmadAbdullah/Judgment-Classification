This is particularly important considering that it is acknowledged that both the accused and co-accused did not conceal their faces while committing the crime.Despite initially challenging the acquittal of the co-accused in the High Court, the complainant later withdrew the petition. This means that the Trial Court's decision regarding the acquittal has become final, and the prosecution's case regarding the murder of one of the deceased has been rejected.

The petitioner/accused filed an application under Section 265-K of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, which was rejected by the Trial Court. They then challenged this dismissal order in the High Court. The complainant claimed to be a tenant at the house-in-question, representing a person with whom the petitioner/accused had long-standing civil or criminal disputes. However, the accused themselves claimed to be the rightful owner of the house-in-question.The allegations in this case involve house-trespass and stealing household articles. Normally, such allegations would require a trial. However, if the accused person has been involved in a legal dispute regarding the same property since purchasing it, then this case would be an exception. In this situation, no offense of trespass can be made against the occupant, whether they are the claimed purchaser or tenant, even if their claim is under litigation. Therefore, the alleged occurrence cannot be considered an act of trespass by the accused. The complainant himself stated in his evidence that the accused persons committed the occurrence and instructed the co-accused to vacate the house.The records indicate that the complainant's version was not supported by independent witnesses, such as the Chowkidar. As a result, a report was submitted under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, classifying it as an A-Class case, which discharged the nominated accused. Although the Magistrate's Court had the authority to consider even a negative report under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, this did not exempt the Court from examining undeniable or undisputed documents or facts, such as those related to previous civil and criminal litigation between the parties, when deciding an application under Section 249-A or 265-K of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. The Court also had to consider the possibility that the prosecution would not be able to prove any charges against the petitioner/accused, even if the trial were allowed to continue.The current case involved exceptional circumstances, leading the High Court to invalidate the proceedings of the Trial Court against the petitioner/accused.

The distance between the location of the incident and the police station was six kilometers, indicating that the report was made promptly without any delay. Since the incident happened in broad daylight and the parties involved were familiar with each other, there was no possibility of mistaken identity. The complainant and another witness provided firsthand accounts, and they were extensively questioned by the defense. However, no evidence was presented that supported the accused or undermined the prosecution's case.The complainant was a resident of the house where the incident occurred, so it was expected for him to be present. As for the other witness, it was acknowledged that at the time of the incident, the deceased lady's wedding ceremony was taking place and he, being a close relative, had come to the complainant's house to attend the ceremony.The medical evidence presented in the case supported the details of the injuries sustained by the deceased, including their nature, time, location, and impact. The defense counsel failed to provide any reason as to why the complainant would falsely implicate the accused and let the real culprit go free. It is uncommon for substitutions to occur in cases like this. The complainant would not choose to spare the real culprit who murdered his daughter and instead falsely accuse the accused, who is his son-in-law and maternal nephew, without any motive. The defense did not seriously challenge the motive presented by the prosecution, and the prosecution witnesses were not questioned about this aspect. It is worth noting that the accused was a fugitive for approximately six months, which further supports the case against him.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, even without taking into account the recovery of the weapon used in the crime, there was sufficient evidence in the form of reliable eyewitness accounts, medical evidence, and motive to support the conviction of the accused for the serious charge.
